# Mexty Technical Test - Interactive Block

Welcome to the Mexty technical test! Your mission is to create an **interactive, customizable experience** as a reusable block.
See examples on [Mexty's marketplace](https://workspace.mexty.ai/marketplace)

## 🎯 Objective

Create an engaging, interactive experience that can be **customized through props** and works on a specific topic of your choice.

### Requirements

✅ **Must have:**
- An interactive experience that users can engage with
- **Props support** - the experience must be customizable via props (difficulty, theme, settings, etc.)
- Use **@mexty/realtime** for multiplayer/realtime features (already included in dependencies)
- Work on a specific topic (education, entertainment, productivity, etc.)
- Be creative and show your skills!

❌ **Forbidden:**
- Quiz/QCM formats
- Crossword puzzles
- Any basic question-answer systems

### Ideas to Inspire You

Think beyond traditional educational formats! Here are some directions:

- **Collaborative Drawing/Art** - Create together in real-time (customizable: canvas size, brush types, themes)
- **Memory/Matching Games** - Find pairs, sequences (customizable: difficulty, card types, themes)
- **Escape Room Puzzles** - Logic puzzles, pattern matching (customizable: puzzle type, difficulty)
- **Interactive Storytelling** - Branching narratives (customizable: story theme, choices)
- **Music/Rhythm Experiences** - Create or play music together (customizable: instruments, tempo)
- **Strategy Games** - Chess variants, board games (customizable: rules, board size)
- **Simulation Experiences** - Physics, chemistry, biology simulations (customizable: parameters)
- **Word Games** - Hangman variants, word associations (customizable: word lists, difficulty)
- **3D Experiences** - Like the included example! (customizable: model, animations, camera)

**Be creative!** The best submissions show technical skills AND innovative thinking.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 2. Development Mode

```bash
npm run dev
```

Opens Vite development server at `http://localhost:5173` with hot reload.

**This is where you build your block!** Edit `src/block.tsx` and `src/App.tsx`.

### 3. Build Your Module

```bash
npm run build
```

Creates the production webpack bundle with Module Federation in the `dist/` folder.

### 4. Test Your Built Module

```bash
npm run test
```

Opens test playground at `http://localhost:3002` where you can:
- ✅ Load your built webpack federation module
- ✅ Test props customization in real-time
- ✅ Verify everything works as expected

**Important:** Always run `npm run build` before `npm run test` to test the latest version!

## 📝 What to Submit

1. Your completed code in the `src/` folder
2. A brief description of your experience in this README (add it below)
3. Example props that showcase different configurations
4. Make sure `npm run build` && `npm run test` works!

## 🏗️ Project Structure

```
src/
├── index.tsx     # Entry point for development
├── App.tsx       # Exports the mount function for Module Federation
├── block.tsx     # Your main Block component (customize this!)
└── styles.css    # Your styles
```

## 📚 Available Libraries

Already included in this project:
- **React 19** with TypeScript
- **@mexty/realtime** - For multiplayer/realtime features
- **@react-three/fiber** & **@react-three/drei** - For 3D experiences
- **Three.js** - 3D graphics
- **Zustand** - State management
- **Tailwind CSS** - Via CDN (see index.html)

Need more? Add them to `package.json`!

## 💡 Props System

Your block receives props through the `BlockProps` interface. Example:

```typescript
interface BlockProps {
  // Define your customizable properties here!
  difficulty?: 'easy' | 'medium' | 'hard';
  theme?: string;
  playerCount?: number;
  // ... whatever makes sense for YOUR experience
}
```

These props can be changed in real-time in the test playground!


## ⏱️ Time Guideline

This test is designed to take **2-4 hours**. Focus on:
1. ✨ Core interactive experience (60% of time)
2. 🎛️ Props customization (20% of time)
3. 💅 Polish and UX (20% of time)

**Quality over quantity!** A well-executed simple experience is better than a complex but buggy one.

Good luck and have fun! 🚀

## 🔄 Realtime Implementation (@mexty/realtime)

This block now supports collaborative play. Multiple users joining with the same `roomId` share:

- A shared aggregate score (`sharedScore`) across the room
- Per-user presence (name, color, lastActive timestamp, personalScore)
- Automatic heartbeats every 15s to refresh presence

### How It Works

`src/realtime.ts` wraps the SDK `useCollabSpace` hook with a typed document shape:

```ts
interface RealtimeState {
  sharedScore: number;
  missionsCompleted: number;
  presence: Record<string, {
    name: string;
    color: string;
    lastActive: number;
    personalScore: number;
  }>;
}
```

On successful mission validation we:
1. Update local player score
2. Increment shared aggregate via `adjustSharedScore(delta)`
3. Store the player's updated personalScore in presence with `setPersonalScore(newScore)`

Presence entries are created lazily if missing and refreshed on an interval. No explicit project ID is required for the current SDK usage.

### Example Props

```json
{
  "roomId": "circuit-room-alpha",
  "difficulty": "medium",
  "theme": "light",
  "playerCount": 1,
  "viewMode": "2d-schematic"
}
```

Open two browser tabs with the same `roomId` to see shared scoring update in real-time after each mission validation.
